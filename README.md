### An Angular/Bootstrap Portal

[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) + [Brunch](http://brunch.io)

#### ** MAJOR UPDATES **
v0.10.6b run `./scripts/init.sh`



## How to use
`brunch new https://github.com/johnjarrard/business_center`

You must also install packages using bower. Either

```
bower install
```
or
```
./node_modules/.bin/bower install
```

### Running the app during development

* `./scripts/server.sh` to serve using **Brunch**

Then navigate your browser to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)

*NOTE:* Occasionally the scripts will not load properly on the initial
load. If this occurs, refresh the page. Subsequent refresh will render
correctly. Also, the initial load will take longer then subsequent loads,
some where around 20 seconds is normal.
